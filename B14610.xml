            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

So that it should seeme in verie deede, that for them it was first
<pb facs="tcp:176336:4"/> framed by the author him selfe, as hauinge an especiall care of them. As for the learned, and skilfull, they haue farre better, and greater helpes, &amp; therefore lesse neede it: yet may they profit them selues somewhat, if they will vouchsafe to looke so lowe, and consider the compendiouse, true, and right way of exposition therein vsed. For they shall see how one place of scripture is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the other: the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and darke, by the more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, and cleare: and euery ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle so fully confirmed by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies of Gods word, that we neede not once doubt, or stagger in the principles of our faith, which ought to be firme &amp; sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast, being grounded, and built on so good, and sure a foundatiō. But the intent and purpose of the authour, (as I saide,) was
<pb facs="tcp:176336:5"/> chiefly to benefit, and pleasure by this his paines, the ignoraunt, vnlearned, and poorer sort, and therefore labored to be shorte, and plaine. Short, partly least it should deterre the most part from reading of it, which are soone wearie of well doing: part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly also that the volume being but smale, they might the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be induced to buy the same. Thus laboring to be briefe, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding he hath so well tē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered his stile, that he is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure: &amp; indeuoring to be plaine, he is not ouer tedious: which should not seeme so easie a thing, seeing that the most part in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting do herein offend. Wherfore (gentle reader) I doubt not but thou wilt giue him thāks, which hath taken this paines for thy profit, and hath shewed thee so readie away to the attaining of

                     <p>When the holy Scripture for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth vs, to pray and to call vpon any other, but vpon one only God, we must not simply vnderstande that we ought not to make our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest but to God only: for we reade that requests haue oftentimes bene made to men. But it must be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode of prayer, which is made to him, vnto whom we haue our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, as vnto our onely hope, and as vnto him which is author of all goodnes, and which hath al power: that which can not be giuen or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:176336:16"/> to any other but to God alone, without manifest sacrelege. Nowe when we request men it is far after an other sort: for it is onely as the instrumentes &amp; seruaunts of God to whom he hath giuen power and the meanes to helpe vs. The which ought well to be marked in all prayers made to creatures lest that thinking to be religious we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come superstitious in ouershadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; darkening the glorie of God. Aboue all we ought to take heede lest we fal into the errour of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes and paganes, which do well confesse that which now we speake of, and in the meane time do bring in the inuocation of the dead, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and clokinge themselues with their distinction, to wit, that they do not cal on thē as on the soueraigne Lord, for they leaue to God (saye they) his soueraignitie: But it is a thinge most sure and certaine that their imagination is ioyned with I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, forasmuch as they do tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sport the glory of God alone to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: And to this purpose ought the examples of the holie Patriarkes, Prophets, and Apostles to serue for
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:176336:16"/> vs which neuer did once call vpon Adam, or Abell, or Enoch, or Noe, or Abraham, or Isaacke, or Iacob, or anie of their predecessors, but God onely. And the holy scripture maketh no mention but that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocations or supplications at anie time were adressed to God alone. And hereunto also maketh the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and doctrine of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, the example: for he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer cried but to his father. The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: for giuing vs the fourme &amp; manner of prayer, he doth teach vs to addresse our selues to his father alone: When ye shall pray, ye shall saye, <hi>Our father &amp;c.</hi> But if that wee might addresse our selues vnto the dead, he ought, for distinctions sake to say, when ye shall pray to God, or, &amp;c. yea shall say &amp;c. In that he hath not set downe any distinction of prayers, either he was not well aduised (which is most detestable blasphemie:) or else he doeth suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently shew that none other ought to be called vpon but God alone.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>In this request we do not desire that which he will: for the will of God is done alwayes, will we, nill we. But it is in our behalfe that we desire it of him. First we denie and renounce all our lustes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, forsaking and abandoning all our affections and leauing them to God, and praying him that he woulde not suffer thinges to fall out according to our lustes, but as he shal see and know them to be good, and according to his will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Secondarily that he woulde create in vs a new harte and a new will in such sort that we will and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire nothing but that which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:176336:39"/> and liketh him, and that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth. Thirdly that all those to whom God hath giuen any charge, may duely acquite them selues of their dutie, as the Pastours and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters toward the Church, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates and rulers toward the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the teachers toward their schol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lers, the fathers and mothers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their children, and contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the children toward their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and mothers, and the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes and wifes mutually the one toward the other. He addeth, <hi>As in heauen.</hi> For in heauen there is none that resisteth his will: but the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est ioy of Celestiall creatures is to liue vnder the pleasure and will of God.</hi>

Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ therefore hath felt and experimented the great distresse of death and together the paynes of hell, that is to say the wrath and curse of God: the which feeling hath penetrated vnto the verie depth of his heart, and vnto his soule, and bred vnto him extreeme tormentes and troubles, with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customable feare.

According to the first exposition, we confesse that Iesus Christ hath throughly satisfied for vs, and hath left nothing which was necessarie for to appease the wrath and anger of God, to satisfie his iustice and to giue full remission of sinnes.

All his life longe he was conuersant in great humility, and basenesse, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge the infirmitie, wherewith he was enuironed for a time as that he was borne in a stable, that in all his life he was as an artificer, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicall person, and aboue all that in fine, he was hated and abhorred of all, enemie to ech one, defigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with buffets &amp; spittinges, crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with thornes, hanged betwene two theeues, as though he had byn the most detestable that euer was, or was known. by the which meanes he became an offense to men, euen vnto his owne disciples. But behold the resurrectiō, which is a certaine

                        <hi>This article is added for to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what that assemblie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie is which we haue named the Church, and doth signifie that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the members thereof there is a coniunction, that is to lay a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, communion, communaltie, and societie, and that they are as a bodie of a common weale, euerie one being partaker of the common priueledges of the same, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating togeather in all things. This societie hath two bondes, to wit faith and charitie. By faith all the riches and treasures of Christ are made common vnto vs, in such sorte that without any acception of persons all may be made partakers thereof. Wherefore all those that haue faith are called into an hope of vocation, into a looking for of one resurrection, and one inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of euerlasting life, and are led &amp; cōducted by one Spirit, receiued into one selfe same participation of the bodie &amp; blood of the Lord, mē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:176336:115"/> of one Church, by one faith, &amp; one baptisme. The second band is charitie, through which the one cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth to the other, that which they haue receiued of God, be it in spirituall grace, or temporall goodes. For although there is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of these thinges, that God distributeth them to some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly and not to others, or to some more to some lesse, as he will, and according as he knoweth it to be expediēt, notwithstanding all ought to be referred through charitie to the common profit and vtilitie of the whole Church, and serue for the wellfare of all the members, which Sainct Paule doth so well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in this notable comparison which he maketh of the bodie of man and the members thereof, with the bodie of the Church, and the members of the same.</hi>

                     <p>Exod. <hi>3.15.</hi> And God spake further vnto Moses, thus shalt thou say vnto the children of Israell, the Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sack, and Iacob, hath sent me vnto you:
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:176336:128"/> this is my name for euer, and this is my memoriall vnto all ages. <hi>16.</hi> The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Izhak, and Iaakob.</p>
                     <p>Exodus. <hi>5.1.</hi> Then afterward Moses and Aaron went and said to Pharaoh, Thus saith the Lord of Israell, let my people goe, that they may celebrate a feast vnto me in the wildernesse.</p>
                     <p>Isaias. <hi>42.5.</hi> Thus saith God the Lord (he that created the heauens, and spred them abrode: he that stretcheth foorth the earth, and the buddes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: he that giueth breath vnto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vpon it, and spirit to them that walk therein.</p>
                     <p>Isaias. <hi>45.22.</hi> For I am God, and there is none other. <hi>13.</hi> I haue sworne by my selfe: the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousnesse, and shall not retourne, That euerie knee shall bowe vnto me, and euerie tongue shall sweare by me.</p>
                     <p>Isaias. <hi>57.15.</hi> For thus saith he that is high and excellent, he that inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the eternitie, whose name is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie one, I dwell in the high and holie place, with him also which is of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite and humble spirit, to reuiue the spirit of the humble, and to giue life to

                     <p>Amos. <hi>9.6.</hi> He buildeth his spheres in heauen, and hath laide the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his globe of elementes in earth, he calleth the waters of the sea, and powreth them out vpon the open earth: the Lord is his name.</p>

                        <hi>God that he might giue autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to his Law, vseth a verie fitte preface for the same. First he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him selfe Lord, to declare that he hath all power, and to whom is due all obedience, for asmuch as he it is, which hath neither beginning nor ending, and of whom, and by whom, and in whom all things haue their beinge. By these titles also he separateth him selfe, from all false and fayned Gods, which men haue inuented and forged vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: as if he should say, I am the true God, which haue mine atuho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of my selfe, and not at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of men, and without anie right that they can therein pretend. But I am the Lorde, I am God by my selfe. It is I one he that haue autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to commaund and giue lawes.
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:176336:129"/> It is to me that all honour, homage, and obedience is due. It is I onelie, that can take vengeance of all those which shall be rebellious, and that will not obey me: and there is none other but I alone, which haue such power, for I am the Lord thy God, and all other Gods are nothing else but lies and vanities.</hi>

                     <p>Deut. <hi>4.20.</hi> But the Lord hath taken you and brought you out of the iron fornace: out of Egipt to be vnto him a people and inheritance, as appeareth this day.</p>
                     <p>Deut. <hi>7.6.</hi> For thou art a holie peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vnto the Lord thy God, the Lord thy God hath chosen thee, to be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

                     <p>Deut. <hi>10.12.</hi> And now Israell, what doeth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to feare the Lord thy God, to walke in all his wayes, and to loue him, and to serue him, the Lord thy God, with all thine heart, and with all thy soule?
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:176336:130"/>
                        <hi>13.</hi> That thou keepe the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of the Lord, and his ordinaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which I commaund thee this day, for thy welth. <hi>14.</hi> Behold heauen, and the heauen of heauens is the Lordes thy God, and the earth with all that therein is. <hi>15.</hi> Notwithstanding the Lord set his delight in thy father to loue them, and did chose their seede after thē, euē you aboue all people, as appeareth this day.</p>
                     <p>Deuter. <hi>14.1.</hi> Ye are the children of the Lord your God. &amp;c. <hi>2.</hi> For thou art an holie people vnto the Lord thy God, and the Lord hath chosen thee to be a precious people vnto himselfe, aboue all the people that are vpon the earth.</p>
                     <p>Deut. <hi>26.18.</hi> And the Lord hath set thee vp this day, to be a precious people vnto him (as he hath promised thee) and that thou shouldest keepe all his commaundementes.</p>
                     <p>Deuter. <hi>32.8.</hi> VVhen the most high God deuided to the nations their inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritaunce, when he separated the sonnes of Adam, he appointed the borders of the people, according to the nomber of the children of Israell. <hi>9.</hi> For the Lords portion is his people: Iaakob is the lotte of his inheritaunce. <hi>10.</hi> He found him in the land of the wildernesse, in a waste,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:176336:131"/> &amp; roaring wildernes: he led him about, he taught him, and kept him as the apple of his ey. <hi>11.</hi> As an Eagle stirreth vp her nest, flotreth ouer her birds, stretcheth out her wings, taketh thē, &amp; beareth thē on her wings. <hi>12.</hi> So the Lord alone led him, &amp; there was no strange God with him.</p>
                     <p>Isaias. <hi>5.1.</hi> Now will I sing vnto my beloued, a song of my beloued, to his vineyard, My beloued had a vineyard in a very fruiteful hil. <hi>2.</hi> And he hedged it, and gathered out the stones of it, and he planted it with the best plantes, and he built a tower in the middest thereof, and made a vine-presse therein: then he looked that it should bringe foorth grapes: but it brought foorth wilde grapes. <hi>3.</hi> Now therefore, O inhabitants of Ierusalem, and men of Iudah, iudge, I pray you, betweene me and my vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard. <hi>4.</hi> VVhat could I haue done anie more to my vine-yard that I haue not done vnto it? VVhy haue I loked that it should bring foorth grapes, and it bringeth foorth wild grapes? <hi>7.</hi> Surelie the vine-yard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israell, and the men of Iudah are his pleasant plantes, and he looked for iudgement: but behold oppression: for righteousnesse, but behold a crying.</p>

                     <p>Ierem. <hi>2.21.</hi> Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, whose plantes were all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall: how then art thou tourned vnto me into the plantes of a straunge vine?</p>
                     <p>Hosea. <hi>11.1.</hi> VVhen Israell was a childe, then I loued him, and called my sonne out of Egipt. <hi>2.</hi> They called them, but they went thus from them: they sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed vnto Baalim, and burnt incense to images. <hi>3.</hi> I led Ephraim also, as one should beare them in his armes: but they knew not that I healed them. <hi>4.</hi> I led them with cords of a man, euen with bandes of loue, and I was to them, as he that taketh of the yoke from their iawes, and I layd the meate vnto them.</p>
                     <p>Malach. <hi>1.6.</hi> If I am a father, where is my loue?</p>
                     <p>Eph. <hi>2.20.</hi> For we are his workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, created in Christ Iesus vnto good workes, which God hath ordained, that we should walke in them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In this God hath a regard to the couenaunt which he made with his people, choosinge and separatinge them from all the rest of men, as his peculier people: and his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritaunce, and promised that he would be their God, &amp; they should be his people. The which couenant
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:176336:132"/> tended to the end they should ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to him loue, seruice, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as imported these wordes,</hi> I will be thy God, and thou shalt be my people. <hi>By this therefore they were admonished and put in minde of their duetie, to the which they had bound them selues accordinge to the tenour of the couenaunt made, that is, to obey him. Now if this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son ought to be of force and waight among them, it ought to haue no lesse amonge vs. For besides that God hath chosen and created vs, to walke in righteousnes and holines, we haue bounde our selues more sure, when in Baptisme we gaue our selues to his seruice, and renounced our selues.</hi>

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:176336:135"/> afterward the whole Church by his Sonne Iesus Christ, from the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of Satan, sinne, and death. But to acknowledge him for God, it is not onelie to say and confesse with mouth, that there is one God, and that it is he, which hath created all thinges, and is so often preached and declared in the scriptures (for the deuill doeth well confesse the same, and doeth tremble,) but it is to loue him with all our heart, with all our minde, with all our soule, and with all our force and strength: to call vpon him, to honour him, to feare him, to serue him, and to put our whole trust and confidence in him. The other point is, that we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg none other God but him alone: for euerie thing else what so euer it be, if it be adored and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped as God, it is a straunge and false God: and we worshipping it are idolaters, forasmuch as in place of God, we worship an Idoll. First of all by this commaundement are the Paganes and heathenish men condemned, which haue forged a great multitude of Goddes. Albeit they did no whit at all doubt but
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:176336:135"/> that this same was the greatest and chiefest. The Papistes also are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, which do worship and call vpon Sainctes: for there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene their religion, and this of the Pagans, but onelie that they haue chaunged the names of the Idolles, giuing them the names and titles of Angels, of the virgin Mary, of S. Peter, of S. Iames, and of others: the Pagans vse the names of Iupiter, Mars, Neptunus, Iuno, Venus, &amp;c. Also all those which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme of him after their owne fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie, and not as he is manifested in the word, as those which confound the three persons in Trinitie, those which doubt of his might &amp; power, or denieth his prouidence: al those which seeke other meanes of aide &amp; succours, then those which God hath giuen vnto vs, as well all sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers, and witches, necromancers, which by sorcerie, witchcraft, and inuocation of deuilles, would see to theyr owne affaires.</hi> Before me. <hi>this is added for to condemne the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie of the hart: for although one outwardlie shew no signe but of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and Godlinesse, so it is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:176336:136"/> that for the most part, idolatrie is hidde close in the heart. Wherfore God will not measure his seruice by the face of man, which seeth but the outward appearance, but he keepeth that vnto him selfe, forasmuch as he seeth the outward part of a man, and straightwaies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so soundeth the inward thoughtes of his heart.</hi>

To be short he will not be represented bodely in any sort what soeuer, and expressely defendeth it with horrible threates and mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For seeing he is incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, it is great temeritie and foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hardines to seeme to comprehend by our senses his greatnes: seeing he is infinite, to goe about to shut
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:176336:139"/> vp his maiestie, within the compasse of a stocke or stone▪ sith he is inuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to subiect his glorie to our eyes: sith he is spirituall, to giue vnto his substaunce an earthly bodie: sith he is immortall, to make him semblable to a dead blocke, sith he is incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, to present him by thinges that putrifie and perish. The other point is not to worship any Image in waie and manner of religion, not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate them selues before them, to do them any honour, seruice, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and much lesse to call vpon them. Wherefore all those are here condemned, which do kneele down before them, which do speake vnto them, which do tourne their face toward them in praying, which doe kisse them, which doe them reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, which stand bareheaded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, which do giue vnto them faire and costly ornamentes, and do carie vnto them candles.</hi>

Wherefore the Sabbath, in as much as it was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God to this end, did put the people in minde of their pouertie and miserie, to wit, that all that was in them was wicked and naught, wherefore we should ceasse from all our wicked affections and concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scences, and seeke in God all holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. The other end was, that the people might haue a day, in the which they might come together to heare the Law, to do those sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices which were ordained, to keepe the other ceremonies, to partake in publique praiers, and for to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cercise charitie.

For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we are not bound any more to such an outward obseruation as were the Iewes, notwithstandinge the spirituall rest ought of vs dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentlie to be obserued: that is to say, that we ought to renounce all the wicked desires of our flesh, that we may be led and conducted by the spirit of God. &amp;c.</p>
